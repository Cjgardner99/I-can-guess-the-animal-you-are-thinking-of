The point of this program is for it to guess the animal you are thinking of. 
I created it using a binary tree.
When you start this program up in your java console, using the appropraite files, you will be asked a series of yes or no questions in which you must answer, yes or no, and press eneter.
Once the program thinks it has enough data based on your answers it will attempt to guess the animal you are thinking of.
You will then let it it know if it was correct or not.
It it was correct the program will offer you to play again or quit.
if it was incorrect, it will prompt you to enter the name of the animal you were thinking of and a yes or no question associated with the animal you were thinking of.
it will take that data and store it in a text file. this same text file is read in at each execution of the program in order to build the binary tree of questions and animals.
